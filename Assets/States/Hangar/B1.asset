  storyText: "Congrats!\nAppearently you choose to search the abondoned tank. You
    wrote your answer and put to the post box in front of your shelter. 2 days later
    your door is knocked and two local people come to take you to your new search
    area. They didnt know your language and take you to the ship and you went to
    the middle of the pasific ocean for 2 days. And we have to say that you were
    really scared. But when you got there they gave you the new letter and it says
    look at your pocket. You put your hands in your pocket and you found a piece
    of paper. You dont have any idea where the hell this paper got into your pocket.
    But when you open it you found this words: \"congrats\" \r\n\r\n1. Start Again\r\n2.
